# ZeroCard

ZeroCard makes spending cryptocurrency as easy as using cash.

We simplify the crypto experience by:

1.  **Setting up your wallet:** Get a secure crypto wallet with just your email.
2.  **Issuing your card:** Receive a physical or virtual card linked to your wallet.
3.  **Seamless Spending:** Use your ZeroCard anywhere cards are accepted, effortlessly spending your crypto like local currency (Naira, Cedis, Shillings, and more).

No more complex conversions or high fees â€“ just simple, straightforward crypto spending for everyday life.

**Currently focusing on bringing easy crypto spending to Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya.**
